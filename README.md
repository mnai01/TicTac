# TicTacToe
Console based TicTacToe game played against AI written in Python. Worked on with [Bryan B](https://github.com/BryanBorge)

**Tic Tac Toe AI vs Player**
This script runs a console based tic tac toe game which allows a player to go against an AI. It gives the user a chance to pick their desired letter X or O and a choice if the player would like to go first or second.

**Tic Tac Toe GUI Player vs Player**
This GUI script was developed using Tkinter which is a GUI toolkit for python. It is layed out by using button in a tic tac toe format and leting players decide what letters they want to be, they then can verse each other.
